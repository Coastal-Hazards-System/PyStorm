# PyStorm

### *A Modular Python Framework for Probabilistic Modeling of Coastal Storm Hazards*

---

## 🌊 Overview

**PyStorm** is an open-source, modular framework for probabilistic modeling and analysis, designed for engineers, scientists, and researchers working on coastal hazard quantification, stochastic storm simulation, life cycle analysis, and extreme value analysis. It is being devloped a Python-based platform supporting both graphical and script-drive workflows for flexible and computationally efficient execution. Future versions of PyStorm will be modular, extensible, and feature a graphical user interface (GUI) for advanced coastal hazard analysis.
